# RTA — Reclaim The Attention (Ṛta / ऋत)

RTA is a minimal Android launcher built to reduce distraction and keep app access intentional.

It is not yet the fastest or most optimized launcher, but performance and simplicity are active goals.  
The intent is to improve speed and efficiency without adding noise or complexity.

## Why “RTA” (Ṛta / ऋत)

**Ṛta (ऋत)** refers to order, truth, and balance — the natural way things are meant to function.

RTA is named after this idea.  
It is an attempt to bring a small sense of order back to how apps are accessed.

**Reclaim The Attention** reflects the same intent in modern terms.
